Hi I'm Subham Rath, a pre-final year undergrad from [Silicon Institute Of Technology ,Bhubaneswar](https://www.silicon.ac.in/) .I am passionate about Electronics and have some Specilized skills like Analog and Digital Layout design, STA, RTL design, FPGA implementation etc. 

I am looking for internships in field of Digital and Analog VLSI design. 

- Profile Summary:

    - Good understanding of CMOS Integrated Circuit (IC) design.
    - Basic understanding of CMOS SRAM design and Memory Compiler.
    - Knowledge of CMOS Layout and Scribe Line Layout.
    - Basic understanding of FPGA implementation.
    - Created a temperature sensing circuit using PT100 with LabVIEW interface.
    - Basic training in Logic Synthesis and Static Timing Analysis (STA).
    - Having knowledge about STA, Delay Model & calculation, and familiar with OpenSTA.
    - Familiar with different IO files used in a VLSI flow.
    - Fundamentally strong in Digital/Analog Electronics, Control System, & Analog Communication & Digital Signal Processing.
    - Familiar with Embedded Programming,Experienced in several IoT projects.

- Education:

| Passout Year  | Instituition  | Course | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- | -----  | ----- |
| 2022  | Silicon Institute Of Technology, Bhubaneswar  | B.tech(ECE) | 9.58 |
| 2018  | Sri Aurobindo Science College, Cuttack  | 12th PCMB | 87.63% |
| 2016  | Saraswati Shishu Vidya Mandir, Jagatsinghpur | 10th | 90.33% |

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 28nm CMOS Layout Design
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Digital and Analog Physical Design Flow
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Projects related to VLSI Design
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Analog Circuit Design
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I will help from my knowledge base
